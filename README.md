# Discussion-Reports  

The code located in this repository is from a summer 2019 project for an online course at NYU. The purpose of the project was to create a system for providing students with more automated feedback regarding their participation in an online forum. By running the three data cleaning scripts, html reports are generated for each student, which can then be sent to students via Qualtrics. All of the code was written by me; however, the questions, figure descriptions, and prompts were written by my collaborators. These reports were successfully implemented during fall 2019. All names and content posted here are fake, and I am posting the code primarily as a coding sample. I would like to post an example report; however, it is challenging to simulate data from a chat forum like this and I have not yet had a chance to do so.
