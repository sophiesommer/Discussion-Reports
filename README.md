# Discussion-Reports  

The code located in this repository is from a summer 2019 project as part of the Learning Analytics Research Network at NYU. The purpose of the project was to create a system for providing students with automated feedback regarding their participation in an online forum. By running the three data cleaning scripts, html reports are generated for each student, which can then be sent via Qualtrics. All of the code was written by me; however, the questions, figure descriptions, and prompts were written in partnership with my collaborators. These reports were successfully sent to students in an online course during fall 2019. All names and course content included here are fake, and I am posting the code primarily as a coding sample. I would like to post an example report; however, I cannot share the data due to confidentiality constraints and have not yet had time to simulate a fake dataset.
